[![CI](https://github.com/deitChi/ansible-role-firewalld/actions/workflows/molecule.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/deitChi/ansible-role-firewalld/actions/workflows/molecule.yml)

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      gather_facts: true
      become: true
      roles:
        - ../roles/firewalld
